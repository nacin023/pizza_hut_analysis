# pizza_hut_analysis

This is a quick dive into where and how Pizza Hut sets up shop across the U.S. I looked at states, cities, what kind of locations they have, and when they're open. 

Texas, California, and Florida love their Pizza Hut.
Big cities, especially Houston and San Antonio, are where you'll find lots of them.
